# [New algorithm for time series clustering: k-visibility]

Contributors: [seigpe]

## Introduction

I would like to include a new clustering algoritm: k-visibility 
https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/math.20241687

Algorithm just been developed for the paper, and I would like to include it in the clustering folder.

## Contents

## Problem statement
New clustering algorithm

## Description of proposed solution

## Motivation
In my PhD, I study time series clustering and networks. We propose a new time series clustering based on visibility graphs.

## Discussion and comparison of alternative solutions

## Detailed description of design and implementation of proposed solution 
I'm just finishing developing a new python file in sktime based on dbscan clustering algorithm located in the folder.
